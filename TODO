## Medium priority

### Backend
- Set up logging of API calls (`rotating-file-stream` or `winston` with `morgan`)
- Improve consistency of handling paper names & codes & labels when using database, GET requests, and forms

### Frontend
- Check pages for accessibility issues
  - Some form fields are missing labels on the `review` page
  - The star rating component can't be done with a keyboard

### Features
- Ability to edit reviews

## Low priority

### Features
- Add a way to search for joint honours courses all together rather than separate subjects

### Data
- Add support for people to specify what special subject they did
- Complete work on course -> subject -> paper structure
  - When submitting a review, fetch the user's subjects as the options for them to choose from
- Associate tutors with subjects and only suggest relevant ones when submitting a review
- Complete subject data
  - Biology masters
  - Biomedical Sciences
  - Classical Archaeology and Ancient History
    - Should split up the arch and history components for prelims
    - Do finals https://examregs.admin.ox.ac.uk/Regulation?code=hsocaandancihist
  - Chemistry finals & masters
  - Engineering science finals & masters 
  - English - missing special options

### Validation
- For the review submission endpoint, check on the server side that:
  - keys in req.body are in the questions.json file
  - values for each question are of the correct type (and perhaps also a permissible value, e.g. for paperCode)
  - subject is one of the user's subjects 

### Forms
- Consider using `react-hook-form` rather than `formik`

### Information
- Explanations of each field in the ReviewSummary

### UI
- Could change:
  - how the navbar is laid out
  - whether to horizontally centre the app or keep it on the left
- Debouncing when typing tutor's name onto search page
- Error messages for `subject` and `paper` are lagged to disappear on review page
  - and some questions missing the exclamation mark icon
  - Also check implementation in profile completion page, seems quite messily-done
- On the search page, if there's an error, the first time it loads the modal shadow 
  doesn't cover the extreme margins (related to the scrollbar hiding).

### Performance
- Implement lazy loading
- Serve images in next-gen formats with appropriate sizing
- Making a GET to `/auth/status` every time the user changes page may be unnecessary
  - The navbar and main content also separately do the call so it's duplicated already

### Code tidiness
- Investigate using React Suspense for loading indicators
- Consider whether repetition in notifications and error handling can be reduced
  - e.g. by using a hook for fetching data and passing it what to substitute in to error message
  ```typescript
    const handleError = useCallback((error: unknown) => {
    console.error('Failed to fetch data:', error);
    showNotification('Failed to load profile data. Please try again.', 'error', [
      {
        label: 'Retry',
        onClick: fetchData,
        variant: 'primary'
      }
    ]);
  }, [showNotification]);
  ```
- Make form components more consistent, e.g. the check of `isRequired` and subsequent red asterisk display
- Work out whether a config file is useful for the frontend
- Implement tests
  - For the frontend, possibly `react-testing-library`
  - On the backend, it might be good to ensure that the JSONs being served are in the format defined by frontend interfaces
    - Could use [VSC schemas](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) for this?
- Better approach to `baseURL` in client-side login
- Probably no need to separately specify BASE_URL and CLIENT_URL in app engine env variables, but code would need changing
- Centralised error handling e.g. if session secret not defined, don't want to keep database connection open
- Email addresses - store as a variable somewhere rather than rewriting if it changes

### Authentication
- Attempts to access a protected page if unauth sends you to `/auth/login` and then if 
  successful redirects back to where you were trying to go, not just homepage
- Autodetect user college from email address rather than having user choose

### Server
- Configure controllers instead of plain routers
